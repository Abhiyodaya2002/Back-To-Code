I am showing you how to create a very simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe in a C# console application.
 
Introduction
 
Tic-Tac-Toe is a very simple two-player game. So only two players can play at a time. This game is also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os game. One player plays with X and the other player plays with O. In this game we have a board consisting of a 3X3 grid. The number of grids may be increased.

 
************************************************************Game Rules*****************************************************************************************************


1 Traditionally the first player plays with "X". So you can decide who wants to go with "X" and who wants to go with "O".
  Only one player can play at a time.
2 If any of the players have filled a square then the other player and the same player cannot override that square.
  There are only two conditions that may match will be draw or may win.
3 The player that succeeds in placing three respective marks (X or O) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.


***********************************************************Winning condition************************************************************************************************
 
Whoever places three respective marks (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally will be the winner.
